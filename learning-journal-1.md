#Learning Journal, Class 2
##May 9 2017

Today in lab, it felt like putting together the Javascript portion of my site took forever, even though a lot of it is repeated steps! I think it's just a matter of practice before it gets faster. The first three questions I really had to think through every step. By the end, it was a lot easier to declare variables and do the whole y/n question thing though, so more practice is probably the way to go there. Basically, it's sort of:
Declare the variable: var name = prompt ('Our question?');
then console.log it:  (console.log('name: ', name))
then start the if statement:
if (some condition regarding y/n) {
  //curly brackets are basically "then"
  we do something in here
} else {
  we do something else
}

Eddie showed me the niftiest thing with the lowercase/uppercase that I would have never thought of. I spent a good 15 minutes on it before asking - but it was one of those "oh man, that is a totally clever thing, not sure if I would have gotten that right away" - basically, you make the user's answer in the prompt become lowercase or uppercase by tagging on one of those .toUpperCase() deals. DUH BEST TRICK EVER

Not crazy that this script runs on the page without a user initiating it, but what can you do! I'm sure that something is coming down the line to reign this thing in so it's a little better on the UX/UI side and less "HELLO I AM AN ANNOYING POPUP."

I also futzed around with CSS - it's really fun! I figured out how to give text a shadow and use pre-existing Google fonts, which is pretty cool. One thing I am struggling with is figuring out what overrides what. I was trying to get two different sections to be different background colors - I tried applying a color to the body and then giving another section a class and making it a different color, but it didn't work. I'm going to keep futzing about with it at home, just to see what I can get it to look like. I'd like to add a picture too! And maybe a nav.

Git so far is actually less confusing than I thought. The weird analogy I have in my head is that it's a lot like track changes in Word, except the doc is hosted on sharepoint. I'm not totally clear on how multiple people contributing to the same central code works though - it sounds like github could become version hell in about five seconds. But there's probably some kind of structure/organization that people use so it doesn't get totally bananas once someone touches it.

I'm still getting used to Atom and using the console to check information. I vastly prefer repl since it is a little easier to see where you've made a mistake (and it's more familiar). But I'm persisting!

Other than that, the class is going at a good pace. I really like that we recap the material right after we learn it, because it really helps cement the information. I also learn better through writing (because it's something I have to physically do to cement the info into my brain - I am sorta a kinesthetic learner this way), so it's easier for me to watch along while Brian codes, although it can be a little hard to keep up with the autofill. Luckily, I am a pretty quick writer.

Anyway, I'm waiting for everything to start exploding in my face and become massively difficult - apparently, that's week 2. So I'll stay tuned.

Also, it was interesting to see what the 401 students this afternoon were up to with the partner showcase thing. It was pretty cool to see what they can do after only a couple of months. Some guy built a bike selector app that tells you which bike to buy based on your body measurements. Interesting! And apparently built with JS! Blows my mind. It's just cool to be able to make stuff out of literally nothing!

###Random Aside
Right now I'm feeling very Isaac Asimov about what the 401 people are building -
>"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"

kinda thing. Does this mean I secretly want to be a wizard? *(Perhaps).*
